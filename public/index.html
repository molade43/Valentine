            <p>
              I met Oluwatomilola where i went to work, on a sunday.I remember i skipped church to attend her own church just to train the media department on how to use the service i provided for them, she was the most inquistive person in the team and i just couldn't help but ask for her number. And then the rest is history.

            <p>Errrm 
              <br>
              It was soo unexpected, 
              I remember the ‘I met someone call’ we had, then the follow up ‘I think I like him’ and next thing is ditching single life with me for true love (women really do be scum too🙄).
              I have seen her go through fears about the relationship to a place of certainty, about you guys and your future together. 
              It’s the way you guys are committed to growth for me, individually and together as a couple, it’s amazing to watch. And it’s the excitement every time she gets to talk to you and about you even after this long.
              Watching this relationship inspires me and gives me hope, I love thé love you both share. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I’m genuinely excited for you guys and plix party jollof rice and small chops is hungrying me, do quick.</p>
